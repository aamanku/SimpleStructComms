# SimpleStructComms
 A simple templated udp server for struct transfer in C++

 Look into `src/` for examples.

 ## Note
 `This is a very simple implementation for transfering custom struct over UDP between applications. Proper communication between different platforms is not guarenteed to work, more advanced serialization procedures are required.`
